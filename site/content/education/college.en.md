### Introduction
The college group is for unmarried young people between the ages of 19 and 25. Remembering the early history of the United Methodist Church and its ties to small student Bible study groups, the college group here at Albuquerque KUMC is a sign of God's continuing mercy. In this hard and stressful life, as we boldly walk in God's grace, we find victory in trading the fears and worries of the world for fellowship with Christ and communion with each other. Through meeting, worship and joyful participation in church ministry we encourage each other and together experience that grace.
