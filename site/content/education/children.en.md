> Just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another. (John 13:34)

To children growing up in this harsh and unstable modern society, the one thing the church has to teach more than anything else iis God's love. People who have truly discovered God's love have faith that doesn't waver in any circumstances. It's our hope that through practicing love, as our motto says, our children will be firmly rooted in God's love and mature into faithful Christians.
